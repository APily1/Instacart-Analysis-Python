# Instacart-Analysis-Python
Data analysis project that investigates data trends from Instacart, an online Grocery Basket app. 

## Tools Utilized: 
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Numpy,Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Excel.

## Objectives
Clean datasets, then merge the following: products, orders, department, and customer data. 
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria (region, loyalty status, income, time or day and product).
Generate customer profiles that are created based on variables and find the differences between each group's ordering habits.

## Techniques Utilized
- Cleaning the data by resolving missing values, removing duplicates and fixing incorrect or mixed data types.
- Merging the data and confirming that the merge was executed properly, then exporting the final file as a pkl doc.
- Explored descriptive stats (max/min, quartiles, mean, stdev) for each variable, along with histograms, scatterplots, and charts for data distribution.
- Grouped data by user, order, and department; derived user order flags (e.g., 'new', 'loyal') and demographics from the aggregated data; validated via crosstabs and value counts.
- Visualized data with Seaborn and Matplotlib: histograms, lines, pie, and various bar charts.
- designed an Excel file that showcases answers to the sales department poised in the project objective. Provided data overview, consistency checks, data wrangling, column derivations, visualizations, and informed recommendations.
